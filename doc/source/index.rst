Welcome to Panther's developer documentation!
============================================

Panther is a tool designed to find common security issues in JavaScript code. To do
this, Panther processes each file, builds an AST from it, and runs appropriate
plugins against the AST nodes.  Once Panther has finished scanning all the files,
it generates a report.

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.
